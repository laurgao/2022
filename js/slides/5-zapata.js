    It’s 5:30—not enough time to go to Razieh’s house party then home by dusk. You’re about to head in the opposite direction, but
    <br/><br/>
    PJ, Lead Research Scientist & Co-Founder of Zapata, is telling you about his Ph.D. That was his first exposure to quantum algorithms research, and 
    <br/><br/>
    it’s so easy to just go with the flow. You sit across from PJ on the subway. “What’s your favorite place?”
    <br/><br/>
    he asks you. You tell him it’s sitting in front of your computer, lost in the world where nothing matters except the current line of code. For him, it’s in a quiet room with a stack of paper, and a full day to work through equations. 
    <br/><br/>
    You tell him how you started off on Zapata’s software team. You started off reading papers just enough to understand the equations enough to translate into code. But then sometimes, you learn about Fourier transforms and you just have to re-derive the formula. You just have to know. Even after your code works. You understand how he feels.
    <br/><br/>
    “Wow, that’s interesting.” To him, it’s the opposite. He started in the world of theory, and simulates his equations in python to understand them better.
    <br/><br/>
    30 minutes after arriving, you tell Razieh you have to leave. Curfew, you laugh. “No no the party hasn’t even started! Call your parents! Eat some food right now!”
    <br/><br/>
    “Uh…”
    <br/><br/>
    “Don’t worry Laura, I’ll drive you back. That’ll save you some time.” Michał, your internship supervisor, chimes in. A plate of curry and beans. You lick your lips.
    <br/><br/>
    On the ride back, you wonder why Michał would take an hour out of the party to drive me. You tell him it’s nice to hang around people a decade older than you. PJ started his quantum computing career in grad school. The relative insignificance of high school.
    <br/><br/>
    “Yeah, I'm thinking if you have a 16 year old that’s a quantum software intern at one of the leading startups in quantum algorithms, and high school is your main concern, now that seems crazy to me.”
    <br/><br/>
    As you walk home—just as the sun dips beneath the horizon—you think about how the world has taken care of you. Who took their bets on hiring a 16 year old, in a field dominated by PhDs?
    <br/><br/>
    Your parents, on the other hand. You know that your parents won’t be happy if they found out you went to a colleague's house party. Your chest tightens as you realize this qualifies as lying by omission
    but that’s ok… maybe? Being friends with people like Michał and PJ will probably do more for  your future success than studying, anyway. Your dad doesn’t understand the importance of knowing people. Your dad, who scoffed when you said one of your goals for going to HYPSM is to meet people. A goal that is an axiom in the startupy world.
    <br/><br/>
    If your parents were aware that you were leaving virtual class to study quantum computing, you wouldn’t be at Zapata right now…
